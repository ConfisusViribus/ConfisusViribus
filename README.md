## Hi, my name is Ralph Watson

## I'm a shark ecologist based in South Africa. 
* I am a marine biologist working for the [Dyer Island Conservation Trust](https://dict.org.za) in Gansbaai, South Africa.
* I am the Scientific Lead at the [Marine Dynamics Academy](https://marinedynamics.org/academy/), teaching interns and students from around the world in subjects of marine ecology, movement behaviour, and biodiversity.
* I work with various shark species (including white sharks, catsharks, and guitarfish), the African penguin,  and the overall ecology of the Gansbaai area.
* My recently submitted PhD revolved around the ecology of the _Poroderma_ species: the pyjama and leopard catsharks.
* Skillsets include anything from starting a project, to publishing it; with computer skills in R (markdown), LaTeX, and qGIS.
